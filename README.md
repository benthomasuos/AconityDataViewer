# AconityDataViewer

This single page html5/javascript app can be used for visualising data from the Aconity 3D additive manufacturing systems.

It uses the HTML5 canvas and d3.js Javascript library in order to overplot the recorded pyrometer data from print builds.

## Project Phases

There are two phases to this project
* A web based data viewer that replays and visualises data downloaded from the Aconity machines
* A live data viewer that displays data as the Aconity machines are conducting builds.
